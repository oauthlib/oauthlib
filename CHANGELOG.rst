Changelog
=========

3.1.1 (TBD)
------------------
OAuth2.0 Client - Bugfixes

  * #730: Base OAuth2 Client now has a consistent way of managing the `scope`: it consistently
    relies on the `scope` provided in the constructor if any, except if overridden temporarily
    in a method call. Note that in particular providing a non-None `scope` in
    `prepare_authorization_request` or `prepare_refresh_token` does not override anymore
    `self.scope` forever, it is just used temporarily.
  * #726: MobileApplicationClient.prepare_request_uri and MobileApplicationClient.parse_request_uri_response,
    ServiceApplicationClient.prepare_request_body,
    and WebApplicationClient.prepare_request_uri now correctly use the default `scope` provided in
    constructor.
  * #725: LegacyApplicationClient.prepare_request_body now correctly uses the default `scope` provided in constructor

* confirm_redirect_uri/get_default_redirect_uri has a bit changed #445
* invalid_client is now a FatalError #606
* Changed errors status code from 401 to 400:
 - invalid_grant: #264
 - invalid_scope: #620
 - access_denied/unauthorized_client/consent_required/login_required #623
 - 401 must have WWW-Authenticate HTTP Header set. #623

OAuth2.0 Provider - Bugfixes

* empty scopes no longer raise exceptions for implicit and authorization_code #475 / #406

OAuth2.0 Client - Bugfixes / Changes:

* expires_in in Implicit flow is now an integer #569
* expires is no longer overriding expires_in #506
* parse_request_uri_response is now required #499
* Unknown error=xxx raised by OAuth2 providers was not understood #431
* OAuth2's `prepare_token_request` supports sending an empty string for `client_id` (#585)

  By default this is included. The method will also emit a DeprecationWarning if
  a `client_id` parameter is submitted; the already configured `self.client_id`
  is the preferred option. (#585)

0.6.0

  `invalidate_request_token`.

  `oob` callbacks.
