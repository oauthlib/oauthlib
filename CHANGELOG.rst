0.6.1 (2014-01-20)
------------------

Draft revocation endpoint features and numerous fixes including:

  is trying to aquire a new set of scopes that are a subset of the original scope.

* (OAuth 2 Provider) expires_in token lifetime can be set per request.

* (OAuth 2 Provider) client_authentication_required method added to differentiate
  between public and confidential clients.

* (OAuth 2 Provider) rotate_refresh_token now indicates whether a new refresh
  token should be generated during token refresh or if old should be kept.

* (OAuth 2 Provider) returned JSON headers no longer include charset.

* (OAuth 2 Provider) validate_authorizatoin_request now also includes the
  internal request object in the returned dictionary. Note that this is
  not meant to be relied upon heavily and its interface might change.

* and many style and typo fixes.

0.6.0
-----

OAuth 1 & 2 provider API refactor with breaking changes:

* All endpoint methods change contract to return 3 values instead of 4. The new
  signature is `headers`, `body`, `status code` where the initial `redirect_uri`
  has been relocated to its rightful place inside headers as `Location`.

* OAuth 1 Access Token Endpoint has a new required validator method
  `invalidate_request_token`.

* OAuth 1 Authorization Endpoint now returns a 200 response instead of 302 on
  `oob` callbacks.
