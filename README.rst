========

*A generic, spec-compliant, thorough implementation of the OAuth request-signing
logic.*

OAuth often seems complicated and difficult-to-implement. There are several
prominent libraries for signing OAuth requests, but they all suffer from one or
both of the following:

1. They predate the `OAuth 1.0 spec`_, AKA RFC 5849.
2. They assume the usage of a specific HTTP request library.

.. _`OAuth 1.0 spec`: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849

OAuthLib is a generic utility which implements the logic of OAuth without
assuming a specific HTTP request object. Use it to graft OAuth support onto your
favorite HTTP library. If you're a maintainer of such a library, write a thin
veneer on top of OAuthLib and get OAuth support for very little effort.

Documentation
--------------

Full documentation is available on `Read the Docs`_. All contributions are very welcome! The documentation is still quite sparse, please open an issue for what you'd like to know, or discuss it in our `G+ community`_, or even better, send a pull request!

Interested in making OAuth requests?
------------------------------------

Then you might be more interested in using `requests`_ which has OAuthLib 
powered OAuth support built-in. See the `requests OAuth examples`_ for
how you can get started.

Using OAuthLib? Please get in touch!
------------------------------------
Patching OAuth support onto an http request framework? Creating an OAuth provider extension for a web framework? Simply using OAuthLib to Get Things Done or to learn? 

No matter which we'd love to hear from you in our `G+ community`_ or if you have anything in particular you would like to have, change or comment on don't hesitate for a second to send a pull request or open an issue. We might be quite busy and therefore slow to reply but we love feedback!

Chances are you have run into something annoying that you wish there was documentation for, if you wish to gain eternal fame and glory, and a drink if we have the pleasure to run into eachother, please send a docs pull request =)
