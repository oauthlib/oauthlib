OAuthLib
========

*A generic, spec-compliant, thorough implementation of the OAuth request-signing
logic.*

OAuth often seems complicated and difficult-to-implement. There are several
prominent libraries for signing OAuth requests, but they all suffer from one or
both of the following:

1. They predate the `OAuth 1.0 spec`_, AKA RFC 5849.
2. They assume the usage of a specific HTTP request library.

.. _`OAuth 1.0 spec`: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849

OAuthLib is a generic utility which implements the logic of OAuth without
assuming a specific HTTP request object. Use it to graft OAuth support onto your
favorite HTTP library. If you're a maintainer of such a library, write a thin
veneer on top of OAuthLib and get OAuth support for very little effort.

Interested in making OAuth requests?
------------------------------------

Then you might be more interested in using `requests`_ which has OAuthLib 
powered OAuth support built-in. See the `requests OAuth examples`_ for
how you can get started.
